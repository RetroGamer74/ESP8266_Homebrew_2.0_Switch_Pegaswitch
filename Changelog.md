# Release 1.0

Fixed issue of poor performance due to ESP8266WebServer.

Improved fast loading.

Still it can fails on injection some times but as it happens in the original one.

Important!!: Nintendo Switch looks to be some issue when password is enabled in Wifi ESP8266 chip. I recommend not to set password while issue is fixed. If you already setup a password you have to reflash the firmware again to clean it.

# Release 0.9b

Poor performance. Very slow injection procedure.
