# Release 1.0

Fixed issue of poor performance due to ESP8266WebServer.

Improved fast loading.

Still it can fails on injection some times but as it happens in the original one.

Important!!: Nintendo Switch looks to be some issue when password is enabled in Wifi ESP8266 chip. When you change the settings, set a new name for the Wifi SSID, and set a new password. Then save and restart the chip. When you scan networks again Nintendo Switch will still show the old Wifi SSID. Be careful to select the right one.

# Release 0.9b

Poor performance. Very slow injection procedure.
